How to Run the Program in Dev-C++ 
 
Open Dev-C++: Launch the Dev-C++ IDE on your system..
 
Create Separate Files: 
Create a new file for Binary Search (binary_search.cpp): 
Go to File > New > Source File. 
Paste the Binary Search code into the editor. 
Save the file as binary_search.cpp. 
Repeat the same steps for Linear Search (linear_search.cpp). 
 
Compile the Program: 
Open the desired file (e.g., binary_search.cpp) in Dev-C++. 
Click on Execute > Compile and Run or press F11. 
This will compile the code and execute it directly within the IDE. 
 
View Output: 
After running, the output will appear in the console window at the bottom of Dev-C++. 
 
Repeat for Other Program: 
Close the current file and open linear_search.cpp in Dev-C++. 
Compile and run it to view the Linear Search program output. 
 
 
 
 
Purpose of the Code
 
This project implements two fundamental searching algorithms: 
Binary Search: Efficiently finds the position of a target element in a sorted list. 
Linear Search: Iterates through the list to find the target element. 
 
 
 





Time Complexity 
 
Binary Search: 
 
Best Case:  O(1) 
Worst Case: O(logn) 
 
 
Linear Search: 
 
Best Case: O(1) 
Worst Case: O(n) 
 
 
_The End_
